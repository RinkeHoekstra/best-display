\section{About this document}
\label{sec:whatabout}

This document contains the source code of a program to present legal
verdicts with explanations to laymen. It is a part of the
\emph{\batna{} Establishment using Semantic web Technology} (\best)
(\href{http://www.best-project.nl}{\texttt{http://www.best-project.nl}})
project, which is a collaboration of the departments of Computer
Science and Law of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. The project has
been granted by the Dutch Organization of Science (\textsc{nwo}) as a
Token~2000 project.

The source code has been written in the style of literate
programming~\cite{Knuth:1983:LP}, using the
Nuweb~\cite{Briggs:1993:NSL} tool. How this works is explained in the
appendix (\autoref{chap:translatedoc}). In short: the programmer produces
a document that describes the program. The description is illustrated
by pieces of program code. The nuweb tool extracts the code pieces and
writes them into source files that can be compiled or interpreted.


\section{The BEST project}
\label{sec:bestproject}

The goal of the \best{} project is, to provide computer-based support
for laymen who are involved in a legal procedure. Due to the high and
raising costs of the legal support that is necessary to pursue a legal
procedure before a legal court, alternative methods are developed to
settle legal conflicts, e.g.\ negotiation, mediation or arbitration.
These procedures will have the best chances to lead to settlements if
the parties have good knowledge about what would be going to happen if
the alternative procedure would be unsuccessful and the dispute would
have to be solved by a judge. Such information is called \batna{}
(Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement). The \best{} project aims
to provide laymen with legal verdicts and legal articles that contain
relevant information for the case of the user. It explains why the
provided information is relevant for the user.

\section{How the layman obtains her BATNA}
\label{sec:horseshoe}

It is envisioned that the to be developed computer tool works as
follows (figure~\ref{fig:horseshoe}):
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
  \centering
@%  \input{horseshoe.pdf_t}
  \includegraphics{horseshoe.fig}
  \caption{Scheme of the \batna{} tool to be developed. See text for
    explanation of the numbers. The part of the task that this program
  is oriented at is indicated with the dashed rectangle.}
  \label{fig:horseshoe}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The user (layman seeking legal support) explains his case in an electronic document.
\item The computer analyses this document. The computer may enter into
  a dialog with the user.
\item The computer translates the information obtained from the user
  in user-oriented legal concepts (using a layman ontology).
\item The computer translates the user-oriented legal concepts into
  literature-oriented legal concepts (with a legal ontology).
\item The computers searches in legal databases (laws, articles about
  law and legal verdicts) for documents that contain information that
  is relevant for the legal concepts.
\item The computer presents the obtained documents to the user,
  together with an explanation and an abstraction/highlighting
  facility.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Ontology of concepts}
\label{sec:concepts}

The core of this project is the \emph{legal concept}, the
description/definition of a legal issue on which e.g.{} a legal
verdict is based. Examples of concepts are \qstring{Act or omission
violating an unwritten rule pertaining of proper social conduct} or
\qstring{Say over subordinates}~\cite{uijttenbroek2007a}.

The legal concepts are not single, unrelated objects, but they are
part of a large structure called an ontology. The ontology is a graph,
that contains concepts and their properties as nodes, and represents
their relationships as arrows.


\section{Resources}
\label{sec:resources}

The display program uses external resources to obtain information.
Information about concepts are obtained from an ontology in the
\href{http://www.openrdf.org}{Sesame} web-application. Information
about relevant legal verdicts are obtained from the data-mining
software Collexis. The texts of the verdicts is obtained from a
database.

\subsection{Ontology}
\label{sec:ontologyoverview}

In the current project an ontology has
been developed using the \textsc{rdf}\index{RDF} (Resource Description Framework, \href{http://www.w3.org/RDF/}{http://www.w3.org/RDF/}) ontology
language. The objects in the ontology and their relationships can be
retrieved using queries in a similar way as \textsc{sql} (Structured Query
Language) queries serve to retrieve data from databases. In this
program, we use the legal ontology to retrieve the following
information:

\begin{itemize}
\item The concepts that are specifications or generalisations of a
  given concept.
\item The explaining text of a concept.
\item The search document of a concept.
\item References to verdicts for which a concept is relevant.
\end{itemize}

The ontology is implemented in the \emph{Resource
  Description Framework} (\textsc{rdf}) language~\cite{rdfwww2008a}.
It is available as a Sesame~\cite{broekstra2002a} web-application and
can be consulted with standardised query-languages
e.g.~\sparql{}~\cite{sparql2008a} and
\serql{}~\cite{broekstra2003a}. In this document we will use
\sparql{}.

In section~\ref{sec:ontology-interface} an interface class is
developed that connects to the ontology

\subsection{Fingerprint}
\label{sec:fingerprint-overview}

One of the properties of a concept in the ontology is a
\emph{fingerprint}, with a related \emph{search document}. The search
document is a set of sentences that tend to be used by judges when
they argue about the concept. Figure~\ref{fig:causalityfp} is an example of a
fingerprint. The data-mining software
(cf.~\ref{sec:datamining-overview}) uses these sentences to find
verdicts for which the concept is important and in which the judge
argues about it. In our application, we use the sentences to recognise
and highlight the paragraphs in the verdict in which the argument
takes place.

\subsection{Database of verdicts}
\label{sec:verdictdb-overview}

For this project we use verdicts that have been published on-line by
the Dutch council of the judiciary on web-site
\href{www.rechtspraak.nl}{\texttt{www.rechtspraak.nl}}. The Counsil of
the Judiciary gave us permission to obtain the verdicts directly as
\textsc{xml} files from their repository. The programs in
\extref{rnlmysql}{http://cli.vu/best/pdf/rnlmysql.pdf}
process the \textsc{xml} files and create/maintain a Mysql database.

@%\begin{itemize}
@%\item A table that lists properties of each verdict.
@%\item Directories that contains for each verdict a file with the text.
@%\item Directories that contain for each verdict a file with a table of
@%  the words in the text.
@%\item Directories that contain for each verdict a similar file with
@%  known words only.
@%\item Directories that contain for each verdict a similar file with
@%  the stems of the words.
@%\item Directories that contain for each verdict a file with a table of
@%  the offsets of text-strings in the verdict that match phrases in
@%  fingerprints.
@%\end{itemize}

Currently the database contains the texts of about~100k verdicts.


\subsection{Data-mining software}
\label{sec:datamining-overview}

To recognise relevant verdicts, currently the software~Collexis
(\url{www.collexis.nl}) is used. Collexis uses the \emph{fingerprint}
concept and a vector-based search strategy.

The terms in the texts are preprocessed with a thesaurus and then a
vector-space is set up in which the frequency of occurrance of words
and phrases (weighted with inverse-frequency weights) are the
dimensions. The set of phrases and
terms with their weight factors is called the
\qstring{fingerprint}\index{fingerprint} of the document.  In this way
for each document in the corpus a vector can be constructed in which
every term or phrase is a dimension. If the inner-product of the
vectors of two documents is large, it is assumed that the documents
are related to each other. To find documents that are related to legal
concepts, for each of the concepts a \emph{search
  document}\index{search document} has been manually constructed by a
legal expert. The search document consists of terms and phrases that
are often used in texts about the underlying concept. When weight
factors are appended to the words and terms, the search document is
its own fingerprint. Documents in the corpus of which the
inner-product of their vector and the vector of the search document is
large, are assumed to be relevant with respect to the concept of the
search document.

@%The program in this document receives references to a set of concepts
@%that are relevant for a certain case, as well as references to a set
@%of legal verdicts for which the concepts are relevant. It is capable
@%to list and explain the concepts themselves, as well as to display the
@%verdicts, with the relevant parts highlighted. For the latter task,
@%the program uses the search documents that belong to the concepts.

\section{The m4_progname program}
\label{sec:m4_progname}


This document describes a (prototype for) a program that performs
point~6 of the list in section~\ref{sec:horseshoe} and in
figure~\ref{fig:horseshoe}. The program performs the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item It is a web \php{} application that is activated in a browser.
\item When it starts, it gets the \textsc{uri} of one or more legal
  concepts (via CGI).
\item Each of the concepts can be found in an ontology on a remote
  ontology server (cf.~section~\ref{sec:ontologyoverview}).
\item The program may find the \textsc{uri}'s of other concepts of
  which the given concepts are subclasses.
\item The program finds in the ontology an explaining text for each of
  the concepts found.
\item The program derives the \textsc{id}'s of \qstring{search
  documents}, one for each of the concepts found,
\item The program performs for each of the concepts a query in a
  data-mining program (cf.~\ref{sec:datamining-overview})
  to obtain the \qstring{search documents}.
\item The program performs for each of the concepts a query in the
  data-mining program to obtain
  the \textsc{id}'s of verdicts for which the concept is relevant.
\item The program displays the concepts with their help files, and
  illustrates them with the verdicts, in which the paragraphs that
  contain phrases from the search document occur are highlighted.
\end{itemize}

The program is in fact a \textsc{php} script that is processed by a
\textsc{http} server e.g.{} Apache on request of remote browsers.
There is a sister-program to the display program, that serves mainly
to edit help-texts.


\subsection{Modes of operation}
\label{sec:opmodes}

The current version has two modes for presentation:
\emph{Document-oriented mode} in which initially a list of relevant
verdicts is presented and \emph{Concept-oriented mode} in which
initially a list of relevant concepts is presented.

In document-oriented mode, the following happens:

\begin{itemize}
\item The computer presents a clickable list of references to relevant
  verdicts.
\item When the user clicks on one of the references, the verdict is
  displayed, as well as two clickable lists of relevant concepts:
  \emph{active} concepts (initially empty) and \emph{non-active}
  concepts. The user can select up to~m4_maxactiveconcepts concepts to become active
  (by clicking). When
  the user places the mouse on top of a concept, an explaining text
  appears in a pop-up window.
\item When a verdict is displayed, the paragraphs that are relevant
  for one or more active concepts are highlighted and strings in the
  texts that correspond to strings in the fingerprint are highlighted.
  The user can choose to have the entire verdict displayed or only the
  relevant paragraphs. To avoid confusion and overload of the user
  cognive capacity, the number of active concepts is limited.
\end{itemize}


The author of this program has the impression that the combination of
multiple concepts in a single verdict might be confusing for a
layman-user and that it might be easier for him to describe one
concept (\qstring{aspect of your problem}) at a time. This can be evaluated
in the concept-oriented mode.

\begin{itemize}
\item The computer presents a clickable list of concepts (\qstring{aspects of
  your problem}).
\item When the user places the mouse-cursor on top of a concept, an
  explanation appears in a pop-up window.
\item When the user clicks on one of the concepts, the explanation of it is
  displayed, as well as a clickable lists of relevant verdicts.
\item When the user selects a verdict, it is displayed and the
  relevant paragraphs and text-strings are highlighted.
\end{itemize}

@%It starts with a set of fingerprints and a set of legal
@%  verdicts for which the concepts associated to the fingerprints are
@%  relevant
@%\item It presents the list of documents and the list of concepts on a
@%  window in a computer screen.
@%\item When the user clicks on a concept, a window opens in which
@%  the concept is explained, as well as the reason that this concept is
@%  relevant. The document list contains only the documents that are
@%  relevant with respect to this concept.
@%\item When the user clicks on a document, the document opens, with the
@%  relevant paragraphs highlighted (e.g.\ with a contrasting
@%  colour). In the paragraph, the words in the fingerprints are
@%  highlighted with another colour. The user can select other concepts to be
@%  highlighted (with different colours) as well.
@%\item There is a summary mode, in which only the relevant paragraphs
@%  are shown. The summary mode can be extended, to display the relevant
@%  pararaphs of multiple documents in a single window.


\subsection{Invocation of the program}
\label{sec:invocation}

The program starts on a \textsc{http} request on the host of the
program. It is meant that the request is generated by another
computer-program that passes relevant concepts in the request.

When the \textsc{url}
\qstring{\url{http://cli.vu/best/display}} is received, the program
starts in a demo-mode. It loads concepts and lists of relevant verdicts
files instead of from the ontology. 

To use the program in its full capability, concept names are added to
the \textsc{url}, like e.g.{}%
 \url{http://cli.vu/best/display/index.php?concept1=Kenbaarheid&concept2=Ernst_en_duur}.


\subsection{Flow of the program}
\label{sec:progflow}

The display program is contained in \verb|m4_webdir/index.php|. 

When invoked in demo-mode it's
main flow is sketched in the diagram in figure~\ref{fig:mainflow}.
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{mainflow.fig}
  \caption{Scheme of the flow of the main program in demo-mode.
    Initially the user chooses between concept-oriented mode
    (\texttt{c-mode}) or a document-oriented mode (\texttt{d-mode}) on
    a set of concepts and associated verdicts. In concept-oriented
    mode the user selects a concept that will be explained and
    illustrated with relevant verdicts. In document-oriented mode, the
    user chooses a verdict and have parts of it that are relevant for
    one or more concepts highlighted. The user can return to the
    initial screen with an \qstring{Opnieuw} button (dashed arrows).}
  \label{fig:mainflow}
\end{figure}

The \qstring{backdoor program} is contained in
\verb|m4_backdoordir/index.php|. The user chooses to either add/modify
a text that explains a concept or to add/modify a text that explains a
legalese word. When the user made a choice, a list of objects of whih
the helptext can be modified is presented and, in case of the
legalese, an opportunity is added to add another legalese word. There
is an \verb|Opnieuw| button to revert to the original screen. A
schematic graph is shown in figure~\ref{fig:helpeditflow}.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{helpeditflow.fig}
  \caption{Scheme of the flow of the \qstring{backdoor} program tot edit
    help-texts. Initially the user chooses to edit either explanations
    of concepts (c-mode) or explanation of legalese (l-mode). Thje
    next screen lists either the concepts or the legalese words for
    which help is available. The user selects one of the concepts or
    words or intends to create an explanation for a new legalese word.
    The next screen allow the user to perform the editing. When she is
    ready, the program reverts to the screen in which the user selects
    another concept or another word.  The user can return to the
    initial screen with an \qstring{Opnieuw} button (dashed arrows).}
  \label{fig:helpeditflow}
\end{figure}


\section{Resources}
\label{sec:resources}

Currently, the program in this document is still in an unfinished
\emph{demo} state. In this state we use mock-up versions of some of
the resources.

\subsection{Fingerprints}
\label{sec:fingerprintfiles}

To each of the concepts belongs a \emph{fingerprint file}. Fingerprint files are stored in the Collexis software, but since I do not yet not know how to retrieve them from there, they are also stored in directory
\verb|m4_fingerprintdir|.

@%Currently, there are~m4_nrofconcepts
@%fingerprints. The first line of the fingerprint file contains the
@%title and each of the following lines contain a weight factor, a
@%\texttt{tab} character and a word or phrase.
@%
@%The concepts are numbered. The name of a fingerprint file is the
@%concatenation of string \texttt{fp} and the number of the concept.
@%
For example, the fingerprint-file for concept~5 (\emph{causality}) is shown in
figure~\ref{fig:causalityfp}.
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
  \centering
\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}
  \caption{Fingerprint file (with weight factors) of concept~5
    (Causality)}
  \label{fig:causalityfp}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Pointers to relevant verdicts}
\label{sec:verdictlists}

Until around june~2008, a set of concepts with labels \texttt{fp}\emph{n}
has been used (\emph{n} a number between~1 and~36). For these fingerprints, a legal expert (Elisabeth Uijttenbroek)
has selected a set of legal verdicts for which the concept that
belongs to the fingerprint is relevant. In appendix~\ref{sec:relverds}
the \textsc{ljn} codes of these verdicts are stored in
files. The older concepts and verdict-lists are used in the
demo-mode. Otherwise, lists of relevant legal verdicts are obtained from
Collexis.


\subsection{Case-groups}
\label{sec:clustered}

Elisabeth Uijttenbroek has created lists of verdicts for which certain
combinations of concepts (fingerprints) are relevant. Let us imagine
that the verdicts and concepts in such a cluster are relevant for a
case that a user (layman) of this program has brought up. These
clusters are listed and stored in \emph{casegroup files} in
section~\ref{sec:casegroups}. The first line in each casegroup file
lists the relevant concepts and the other lines list the \ljn's of the
verdicts that belong to the cluster. The casegroups are used when the
program starts in document-oriented demo-mode.


\section{Program languages}
\label{sec:languages}

To perform the required tasks, we will use \textsc{lamp} (Linux,
Apache, Mysql, \php{}) and Ajax (Asynchronous Javascript and \xml{}). The features of \textsc{lamp} are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Known (at least by me, the author).
\item Open source and available.
\item Platform-independent, in spite of the \emph{L} of Linux.
\item Can be instantly used everywhere where there is an Internet connection.
\end{itemize}

To add speed to the web pages, some elements will be implemented in
Ajax using \href{http://xajaxproject.org/}{xajax}.

\chapter{Display and backdoor program}
\label{chap:dispback}

In this chapter the \php{} code to generate the web pages for the display
program and the associated backdoor program is constructed. Both
programs consist of a single \php{} script named \texttt{index.php}
and located at a place where the web-server can find them. The
programs are controlled with \textsc{cgi} instructions in the header
(cf.{} section~\ref{chap:communication}.).

\section{The PHP scripts}
\label{sec:indexpages}

The main program sets up a regular \textsc{html} page with a header
and a body. Most of the actual work is done in a \php{} function
\texttt{content()} that is called in the body part of the \HTML{}
script. At the end of the script, \php{} functions are included:

@o m4_webdir`'/index.php  @{@%
<?php
  @< initial php statements @>
  \$paginatitel="m4_webpagtitle";
?>
<!DOCTYPE html 
     PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="nl" lang="nl">
  <head>
    <?php
      @< php statements in the header of index @>
    ?>
    @< the html statements in the header @>
  </head>
  <body>
    @< the html statements in the body @>
    <?php
      @< init javascript @>
    ?>
  </body>
</html>
<?php
  function content(){
    @<content van index @>
  };
  @< functions of index @>
 @< php functions @>
?>
@| @}


The \qstring{backdoor} main page:

@o m4_backdoordir/index.php @{@%
<?php
  @< initial php statements @>
  \$paginatitel="m4_webbackdoortitle";
?>
<!DOCTYPE html 
     PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="nl" lang="nl">
  <head>
    <?php
        @< php statements in the header of backdoordir/index @>
    ?>
    @< the html statements in the header @>
  </head>
  <body>
    @< the html statements in the body @>
    <?php

</html>
<?php
  function content(){
    @<content of backdoordir/index @>
  };
  @< functions of backdoordir/index @>
 @< php functions @>
?>
@| @}


Do not forget to create the directories in which the programs reside:


@d create directories @{@%
  mkdir -p m4_webdir
  mkdir -p m4_backdoordir
@| @}



@d php statements in the header of backdoordir/index @{@%
@< initialize tinymce @>
@%@< xajax statements in the header @>
@%@< Javascripts in the header @>
@| @}

\section{Layout and html code}
\label{sec:layout}

The layout has been stolen from Michel Klein's%
\index{Michel Klein|see{Klein, Michel}}\index{Klein, Michel}Michel
 page about the \best{} project
(\href{www.best-project.nl}{www.best-project.nl}).

\subsection{Character encoding}
\label{sec:characterencoding}


Set locale to \verb|m4_locale|:

@d initial php statements @{@%
\$currloc=setlocale(LC_ALL,'m4_locale');
@%printf("\n<!--- locale: %s --->\n", \$currloc);
@| setlocale LC_ALL @}


\subsection{Style-sheet}

The header specifies to use the Unicode%

still causes many problems, so it might be that we want to change this
eventually.

For the rest, the header part is rather straightforward, with a
specification of the style-sheet.

\section{Paint the content windows}
\label{sec:contentwindows}

Design the windows that have been represented as ellipses in
figures~\ref{fig:mainflow} and~\ref{fig:helpeditflow}. For each window
we construct a function that does the work.
Chapter~\ref{chap:communication} describes how these functions are
called (in \autoref{contentvanindex}). The following functions will
be made for the display program:

\begin{description}
\item[display\_nomode:] Enable the user to choose a mode in the main
  display program (\autoref{displaynomodefunction}).
\item[display\_conceptorientedmode:] Manage concept-oriented mode in
  the main display program (\autoref{displayconceptorientedmode}).
\item[display\_documentorientedmode:] Manage document-oriented mode in
  the main display program (\autoref{displaydocumentorientedmodefunction}).
@%\item[edit\_nomode:] Allow to select what helptexts to edit.
@%\item[edit\_concept\_mode:] Allow to edit help-texts for concepts. (\autoref{backdoorcontent}).
@%\item[edit\_legalese\_mode:] Allow to edit help-texts for legal words. (\autoref{backdoorcontent}).
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Set-up of the window}
\label{sec:co-setup}

In concept-oriented mode, the home page displays two panels. The left
panel contains a list of concepts. The user may select one of the
concepts. The right panel displays an explanation of the selected
concepts and the \ID{}'s of relevant verdicts. The user may select one

Explain the user what information she is going to get. Mention that
there are relevant concepts and list them.

The concepts that will be used in this session are stored in an object
of the \verb|Conceptset| class (cf.~\autoref{sec:whichconcepts}).

If the user clicks on a concept, the concept is made \emph{active}%
\index{active concept}\index{concept, active}.
Active concepts will be listed on the right panel and the user may
have their texts annotated and displayed. In \emph{concept mode} at most
a single concept can be active.

To activate the selected concept, generate a \verb|<a>| tag that has
this page as target and that includes the selected concept as the
single active concept in the query-string.

\subsubsection{The right panel}
\label{sec:co-rightpanel}

When the user has selected a concept, the right panel contains an
explanation about it and pointers to verdicts for which the
concept is relevant. The user may select one of the verdicts to be
annotated and displayed.

The following function determines whether the user selected a concept
and-or a verdict and fills the right window:
 
\begin{itemize}
\item If the user has not yet chosen a concept, print only a message to
  urge her to make a choise. Otherwise, proceed.
\item Print an explanation about the concept.
\item Print a list of \ljn's of verdicts for which the concept is
  relevant. The user may select one of the verdicts.
\item If the user has indeed selected a verdict, proceed and display
  the verdict.
\end{itemize}

Information about a concept is stored in an object of the
\texttt{Concepto} class (cf.~\autoref{sec:concept}) that is stored in
the \verb|Conceptset| object. Make variable \verb|\$conc| point to the
object of the concept to be displayed.

Make the lists as tables (not lists), because we have the macro that prints the
concepts as table entries. If selected concepts must be printed, the
second argument of this macro is equal to \verb|TRUE|, otherwise it it
equal to \verb|FALSE|.

Variable \verb|\$conceptcounter| counts the
number of \qstring{active} concepts. The macro assumes the presence of
variable \verb|\$conceptcounter| that contains the number of concepts
that have been listed thus far. If the active concepts are listed, and
there is more than a single active concept, display the back-ground
colours for passages that are relevant for combinations of concepts.

@d make list of concepts @{@%

Print the title of a concept as a clickable reference. Usually the
reference refers to the concept itself, but if a concept is \qstring{in use}
a click should switch the concept off.

\subsection{Edit helptexts for concepts}
\label{sec:concepthelp}

When the backdoor program is in \qstring{concept mode}, we have the
following possible situations:

\begin{enumerate}
\item This is the first screen in this mode. The user should pick a
  concept to be processed. In this situation there is no selected
  concept and there is no user-generated help-text to be processed.
\item The user has selected a concept, but not yet processed it. In
  this situation there is a selected concept, but no user-generated text.
\item The user has selected a concept and processed the help-text. In
  this case, there is a selected concept and there is user-generated text.
\end{enumerate}

Function \verb|edit_concept_mode| asks the user to pick a concept if
its argument is an empty string. Otherwise, the argument should
contain the number of the concept to be processed and the function
allows the user to do so.

@d  edit helptext for concepts @{@%
if(\$_POST['editedtext']!=''){
  @< write new concepttext @>
  edit_concept_mode("");
} else {
  edit_concept_mode(parameter_value_of("m4_selectionkeyword"));
};
@| @}



When the mode of the program is to edit helptexts for concept, first
we have to check whether the user delivered helptext already. In that
case, store the helptext in the right place and allow the user to edit
the text for another concept. Otherwise, we have to allow the user to
edit the text of a selected concept if the user selected a concept, or
to allow the user to pick a concept.

This goes in two stages: 1) select the concept text to be edited and
2) perform the editing. Query Parameter \verb|no| holds the number of
the concept to be edited.

\subsection{Edit helptexts for legalese}
\label{sec:editlegalese}

When the backdoor program is in \qstring{concept mode}, we have the
following possible situations:

\begin{enumerate}
\item This is the first screen in this mode. The user should pick a
  word for which the help-text must be processed or come up with a new
  word for which there is not yet help-text. In this situation there is no selected
  and there is no user-generated help-text to be processed.
\item The user has selected a word or asked to introduce a new word,
  but not yet processed it. In
  this situation there is a selected word (or a code that signifies
  that the user wants to introduce a new word), but there is no user-generated text.
\item The user has generated help-text for a word. The word itself
  resides either in the querystring or in \textsc{post} as a new
  word and there is user-generated text.
\end{enumerate}

Function \verb|edit_legalese_mode| asks the user to pick a word if
its argument is an empty string. Otherwise, the argument should
contain the number of the concept to be processed and the function
allows the user to do so.

\label{editlegalesemodefunction}%

\chapter{Communication between the pages}
\label{chap:communication}

The display script consists of a single \textsc{php} web page. To
perform actions the script evokes itself, with suitable parameters in
the \textsc{url}. Most of the time the user interacts with the program
by clicking on a \verb|<a>| tag that has the page itself as target,
followed by a query-string with parameters that tell the
program what to do.

Currently the following parameters are communicated from page to page:

\begin{description}
\item[mode:] Case-oriented mode of concept-oriented mode
  (cf.~section~\ref{sec:opmodes}). In the backdoor program the mode
  indicates whether the user wants to edit concept explanations or
  legalese explanations.
\item[m4_filenamekeyword:] The name of the verdict to be displayed.
\item[m4_conceptnumkeyword:] The \qstring{active} concepts that have to be
  illustrated in the verdict, or that have to be explained in
  concept-oriented mode.
@%\item[m4_clusterkeyword:] The name of a \qstring{case-group} (a set of concepts
@%  and a set of verdicts for which the  concepts are relevant. See section~\ref{sec:clustered}).
\end{description}


\subsection{Manage the query-string}
\label{sec:managequery}

The querystring is in \php{} scripts available as variable
\verb|\$_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']|. However, we use functions to
encapsulate the querystring.

The following functions will be provided:

\begin{description}
\item[parameter\_value\_of(par):] Return the value of parameter \verb|par|.
  If the parameter is not present in the
  string, return an empty string.
\item[modified\_querystring(par, val):] Return a query-string in which
  parameter \verb|par| has value \verb|val|. The query-string can be
  pasted in the target of an \verb|<a>| tag.
\item[cascmodified\_querystring(ques, par, val):] return query-string
  \texttt{ques} in which parameter \verb|par| has value \verb|val|.
\item[address\_with\_modified\_querystring(par, val):] As
  \verb|modified_querystring|, but generates a full address with querystring. 
\item[address\_with\_unmodified\_querystring(par, val):] Similar to
  \verb|address_with_modified_querystring|. Needed for forms that
  communicate data with the \textsc{post} mechanism.
\item[remove\_filename\_from\_querystring(questr):] Return the
  querystring in the argument, but withe the file-name removed. 
\end{description}

The following function gets the value of one of the parameters from the
query-string. If the parameter is not present in the string, it returns an empty string.

function parameter_value_of(\$parnam){
  parse_str(\$_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'], \$params);

\subsection{Program mode}
\label{sec:mode}

The first thing that the script has to do, is to find out about the
mode. The display program has the three modes \emph{concept-oriented},
\emph{document-oriented} or \emph{no-mode} (initial state, enables the user to
select a mode). The backdoor program has the modes \emph{concepts},
\emph{legalese} or \emph{no-mode}. The mode is passed in the
query-string and can be found with function \verb|parameter_value_of|
(cf.~section~\ref{sec:managequery}). For each of the mode there is a
function that paints the window.

\label{contentvanindex}%
@d content van index @{@%
if(parameter_value_of('m4_modekeyword')=="c"){
    display_conceptorientedmode();
} else {
  if(parameter_value_of('m4_modekeyword')=="d"){
    display_documentorientedmode();
  } else { 
      display_nomode();
  };
};
@| @}


The help-editing program is slightly more complicated, because in that
case, edited help-texts are communicated by way of the \verb|post|
mechanism. There are two ways to invoke the \qstring{select concept} or the
\qstring{select word} window in figure~\ref{fig:helpeditflow}:

\begin{enumerate}
\item From above. The mode parameter has been set, but no concept
  resp.{} word has yet been selected and no text has been returned.
\item From below. The mode parameter has been set, a concept resp.{}
  word has been selected and edited text has been returned. 
\end{enumerate}

The lowest windows should be invoked if the mode parameter has been
set, a concept or word has been selected or the request to edit help
for a new word has been made, but no text has been returned.

So, we have the following parameters:\par
\begin{tabular}{lp{10cm}}
  m4_modekeyword       & Empty, \verb|c| (concept) or \verb|l| (legalese). \\
  m4_selectionkeyword  & Number of the concept or legalese word
                         to edit text for, or m4_newlegaw, to edit text for
                         a new legalese word.\\
\end{tabular}

and we may have user-generated text, that is returned by the post
mechanism. The function \verb|edit_concept_mode| invokes the
\emph{select concept} window if it's argument is an empty string and it
invokes the \emph{edit concept} if it's argument is the number of a
selected concept. The function \verb|edit_legalese_mode| works in an
analogous way.

\label{backdoorcontent}%
@d content of backdoordir/index @{@%
if(parameter_value_of('m4_modekeyword')=="c"){

};

\chapter{Annotation and help}
\label{chap:annothelp}

To provide implicit and explicit help to the user of the programs we
will highlighting, tooltips and helptexts.

\section{Highlighting}
\label{sec:highlighting}

Highlighting means, that some of the texts-strings are typeset in a
different font, in a different colour or on a different background
colour that the strings in it's environment. Highlighting occurs
especially in verdicts, where relevant paragraphs are typeset in a
striking background colour and relevant words in striking foreground
colours. For different concepts or different combinations of concepts,
different colours will be used.  However, if $n$ concepts are relevant
for a certain document, the number of colours explodes to $2^n$.
Therefore, we will restrict to a maximum of three concepts to be
marked in a single document.

The concepts that are used to mark-up the document are called the
\qstring{active} concepts. The active concepts are ordened by numbers.
To colour the paragraph, wrap it into a \verb|span| tag of a
predefined class and define the background colour of that class in a
style-sheet element.

The name of the span classes is derived from the order-numbers in a
way that they can easily be automatically generated.

\begin{tabular}{rl}
\textbf{Nr.} & \textbf{span-class} \\
-      & m4_conceptparnull         \\
1      & m4_conceptparone          \\
2      & m4_conceptpartwo          \\
3      & m4_conceptparthree        \\
1,2    & m4_conceptparonetwo       \\
1,3    & m4_conceptparonethree     \\
2,3    & m4_conceptpartwothree     \\
1,2,3  & m4_conceptparonetwothree 
\end{tabular}

Use a colour-circle to determine which colour to use. The single-concept paragraphs are
coloured in green, red and blue. The double-concept paragraphs are 
coloured with in-between colours and triple-concept paragraphs are
coloured in gray.



@d style sheet elements @{@%
.m4_conceptparnull {
  background: m4_white;
}

.m4_conceptparone {
  background: m4_paleweakgreen;

}


.m4_conceptparonetwothree {
  background: m4_palegrey;
}

@| @}


The relevant words and phrases are coloured in a similar way, by
wrapping in a span tag. The words are coloured for the concept for which
they have the highest weight-factor in the fingerprint. The colour is
more intense than that of the paragraph:

\section{Tooltips}
\label{sec:tooltips}

Tooltips are windows that pop up when the user moves the mouse on top
of a word for which explanation is available. This section provides the
function \verb|tooltipped| that prints a \textsc{html} \verb|<a>| tag
for a tooltip, and a function \verb|preprocessed_tooltiptext| that
makes a text string suitable to be included as text for a tooltip.

\subsection{Walter Zorn's tooltip utility}
\label{sec:walterzorn}

A convenient tool to implement tooltips is
\href{http://www.walterzorn.com/tooltip/tooltip_e.htm}{Walter Zorn's
  Javascript} tooltip%
\index{tooltip} library.

Use this as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Download \verb|wz_tooltip.zip| from
  \url{http://walterzorn.com/tooltip/tooltip_e.html#download/} and
  unpack it.
\item Move file \verb|wz_tooltip.js| to some place where it can be
  found.
\item Load it into the html page, preferably right after the
  \verb|<body>| tag.
\item To have a window popping up with  \qstring{some text} in it, activate
  Javascript function \verb|Tip("Some text")| (e.g.\ in an
  \verb|onmouseover| command. Note, that quotes may only appear in the
  pop-up text as m4_quotverb(`&quot;').
\item Another way to provide text for a tool-tip, is to write it,
  wrapped between \verb|<span>| tags, somewhere in the document. Use
  in that case function \verb|TagToTip('helptext')| instead of
  \verb|Tip|. The argument (\verb|helptext|) is the class of the
  \verb|<span>| tags in which the text has been wrapped. The tooltip
  function \qstring{eats} the original text: it should not appear somewhere in
  the document itself.
\end{enumerate}

We are stubborn, and load the library at the end of the body, because
we already have a facility to load javascripts there.

@d init javascript @{@%
printf("<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"m4_javascriptURL/wz_tooltip.js\"></script>\n");
@| @}

\subsection{Tooltip style}
\label{sec:tooltipstyle}

To associate a tooltip to a text on the display, wrap the text into an
\textsc{html} \verb|<a>| tag in which the \verb|Tip| function is the
content of an \verb|onmouseover| argument.

We will adopt the policy to underline%
\index{underline}\index{tooltip|underline}
texts for which a tooltip is available and do not apply a special
colour. Therefore, we need to discriminate between \verb|<a>| tags
with (hyper)links, \verb|<a>| tags with tooltips and \verb|<a>| tags
with hyperlinks and tooltips. We define the subclasses
\verb|a.ord|, \verb|a.nepa| resp.{} \verb|pah| (Point And Help).

@d style sheet elements @{@%
a.ord {
      text-decoration:none;
      font-weight:bold; 
      color:#b00;
    }

a.nepa {
      text-decoration:underline;
    }

a.pah {
      text-decoration:underline;
      font-weight:bold; 
      color:#b00;
    }

\subsection{Tooltip PHP functions}
\label{sec:tooltipphp}

\begin{description}
\item[tooltipped(text, helptext):] print \verb|<a>| tag with contents \texttt{text} and tooltip with text \texttt{helptext}, without target.
\item[tooltippeds(text, helptext):] return \verb|<a>| tag with contents \texttt{text} and tooltip with text \texttt{helptext}, without target.
\item[reference\_with\_tooltips(text, helptext, target):] return \verb|<a>| tag with contents \texttt{text} and tooltip with text \texttt{helptext}, that points to \texttt{target}
\end{description}

\textsc{Php} function \verb|tooltipped| prints a text wrapped in an
\verb|<a>| tag that generates a tooltip. It receives two
arguments:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The text to be \qstring{tooltipped};
\item A string that contains the text that should appear in the tooltip.
\end{enumerate}

This function uses the \verb|Tip| function (not the \verb|TagToTip|
function because this can become troublesome when facilities like
\verb|ajax| are used).

Note that the \verb|<a>| tag does not have a \verb|href| argument.
This is, because that argument causes the text to be displayed in
special colours, and we don't want that. We want to use underline
instead of colours, and I dont know of a way to paint an
\verb|<a>| tag content in the colour of the next higher level in the
hierarchy.  It might be, that the absence of the \verb|href| argument
causes trouble in some browsers.

@d php functions @{@%
function tooltipped(\$doctext, \$tttext){

\section{Manage helptexts }
\label{sec:managehelptexts}

Most of the help-text that e.g.{} pop up in tooltips are stored in
help-files. Generally, a help-file consists of lines that begin with
an identifier, followed by a \verb|tab| character, followed by the
text for a single item. The following sections describe a class to
manage such files and a sub-class to manage a file that contains descriptions
of concepts. The latter will become obsolete, because these texts will
be retrieved from the ontology.


\subsection{A class for help-texts}
\label{sec:helptextclass}

The following class Helptext loads a help-file and makes the helptexts
available. It provides the following methods:

\begin{description}
\item[Helptext] Constructor that does practically nothing.
\item[fill\_with\_file:] Reads a file with help-texts (First argument
  is filename).
\item[save:] Back-up a file (First argument is
  filename) and store the help-texts in a new version of the file.
\item[gettext:] Return the text that is associated with the first argument.
\item[printtooltip:] Print a tooltip tag. The first argument is the
  pointer to the helptext and the second argument is the text to be tooltipped.
\item[onmouseoverriedel:] Produce a string with an \qstring{onmouseover}
  statement to be pasted into an \verb|<a>| tag.  
\end{description}

@d php functions @{@%
class Helptext {
  var \$texts;
  var \$empty=TRUE;

  function Helptext(){
    \$this->texts[0]="empty";
  }

  @< methods of the helptext class @>
}

@| Helptext @}

Read a tab-separated file with helptexts. Make empty if this is not
successful.

@d  methods of the helptext class @{@%

    while(!feof(\$handle)){
      \$linarr = explode("\t", rtrim(fgets(\$handle)));
      if(\$linarr[0]!=""){
        \$this->texts[\$linarr[0]]=\$linarr[1];

      return TRUE;
    } else {
      return FALSE;
    };

@| save @}

Return a string with the helptext that belongs to an item.

@d methods of the helptext class @{@%
function gettext(\$item){
  return \$this->texts[\$item];
}

@| gettext @}

Print a tag with a tooltip. Arguments:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The pointer to the text to be displayed in the tooltip;
\item The text to be printed between the \verb|<a>| and the
  \verb|</a>| tags.
\end{enumerate}

@d methods of the helptext class @{@%
function printtooltip(\$pointer, \$label){
  tooltipped(\$label, \$this->texts[\$pointer]);
}

@| printtooltip @}


Sometimes, we build a special \verb|<a>| tag, e.g.{} that really
points to something. In that case, use the following method to produce
a string with the \qstring{onmouseover} argument.

Get a string with the \qstring{onmouseover} argument, to be pasted in an
\verb|<a>| tag.

\subsection{Help texts for concepts}
\label{sec:concepthelp}

Explain concepts in tooltips or otherwise. The help-texts are listed
in a file, \url{m4_helpdir/concepthelp}. This file consists of
lines, in which fields are separated by tab characters. The first
field is the number of the concept and the
second field the explanation. Here a prototype for this file:

\subsection{Help texts for legalese}
\label{sec:legalesehelp}

The user can be helped by explanations of legal words. To this end we
have a file, \url{m4_legalesefil}, that contains legalese words and their
explanations. This file consists of texts lines that start with a
legal word to be explained, followed by a \qstring{tab} character , followed
by an explaining text. Create a class to load the contents of this
file and to make it available. The class contains arrays to store the
legalese words and the explanations. There is also an array to count
the number of times that each word has actually been used.

This class should actually be a subclass of the Helptext
class. However, I made this class first and it works. Therefore, I
leave it as it is.

The Explaintexts class provides the following methods:

\begin{description}
\item[Explaintexts:] Constructor. Reads the texts from  \url{m4_legalesefil}.
\item[save:] Save the texts in \url{m4_legalesefil}.
\item[wordcount:] Return number of explained words. 
\item[reset:] Resets the object (in order to go over all the legalese
  words again).
\item[getnextword:] return next legalese word.
\item[getcurrentword:] return the legalese word that the internal
  pointer points to.
\item[make\_current\_word:] Make the word in the argument the current word.
\item[getexplanation:] get the explanation text that belongs to the
  current word.
\item[report\_times\_found:] update the registration of the number of
  times that the current word has been found.
\item[times\_found:]  report the number of times that the last word
  has been found.
\item[explain\_texts] return the help-texts of words that have been
  used if a form that is suitable for tooltips.
\item[onmouseoverriedel:] Create an onmouseover tag with the help-text
  of the current word.
\item[wordtotooltip:] Return a string that is similar to the string in
  the first argument, but in which the legalese words have been
  replaced by \qstring{tooltipped} words that provide explanations.
\item[insert\_text:] Insert new text (arg~2) for a new or existing word (arg~1).
\item[remove:] Remove a word with its explanation.

@| wordtotooltip @}


The legalese words may appear lowercased, capitalized (first word in a
sentence) or in other forms. The \verb|wordtotooltip| function will
find lowercased, capitalised and uppercased forms and typesets them
identically in the reference tag.

The \php{} function \verb|preg_replace| accepts an array of patterns to
match and an array of replacement strings.
legalese words by \textsc{html} tags that invoke tooltips. The aim is,
to find and replace words in lowercase form, capitalised form and
uppercased form.

@d make a pattern to find the legalese words @{@%
   \$pattern=array(
          0 => "/".strtolower(\$legawoord)."/",

          2 => "/".strtoupper(\$legawoord)."/"
   );
@| \$pattern @}

Legalese words are replaced by \verb|<a>| tags that typeset the word
itself and add an invocation of the \verb|Tip| Javascript
function. (In a former version we appied the \verb|TagToTip| form that
has the advantage that for multiple instances of a legalese word, the
explaining text needs only once to be communicated to the
client. However, direct inclusion of the text into the tag is
simpler).

The string \verb|\$replastring| is a template of the replacement
string, in which the word to be typeset is replaced by the placeholder
(\verb|aapnootMies|). The array \verb|\$replacement| is filled with three
versions of \verb|\$replastring|, in which the replacement is replaced
with respectively the lowercased, the capitalised and the uppercased
form of the legalese word.

\chapter{Print the annotated verdict}
\label{chap:printannotated}

Insert the text of a selected verdict, annotated according to a
selected concept. In fact, this function does not actually print or
display, but it produces a single string with the \textsc{html} coded
text (\verb|\$uittext|) and returns this as function result. The
following function does not write directly, but produces a text string
with the text. The string is further processed by a function that is
embedded into Ajax (cf. section~\autoref{sec:wrapinajax}.

@%To do this, we need to know things about the
@%locations of paragraphs, sentences and about phrases in the text that
@%are related to the concepts. These things are stored in an
@%\emph{offset table} (in a separate file) and in a \emph{concept
@%  file}. With this information we can calculate which parts of the
@%text should be highlighted and in what way they should be highlighted.
@%
@%We use the pseudo-database structure \verb|rnldb|. In it, the texts
@%are located in \verb|m4_uitspraaktextdir|, the offset tables (for
@%paragraphs, sentences and words) in \verb|m4_uitspraakstabdir| and the
@%offsets of fingerprint phrases in \verb|m4_uitspraakconcdir|. Return
@%the \textsc{html} text to be displayed as a single string. If the boolean
@%argument \verb|\$entire| is equal to \verb|TRUE|, print the entire
@%document. Otherwise, print only the relevant parts.

\section{Manipulate the text from the database}
\label{sec:gettext}

Obtain the texts from the database. To do this, we need the \texttt{rmp} library.
@d initial php statements @{@%
require_once("m4_rmplib");
\$rmp=new Rmp();
global \$rmp;
@| @}

Store the tokens of a text-segment of a document in an object. Class
\texttt{Seqtoks} stores the tokens and perform required tasks with them.

@d functions of index @{@%
class Seqtoks{
@%global \$rmp;
@< message system for class @>
@< variables of the Seqtoks class @>

Three arrays for the tokens, the sentences and the paragraphs.

@d variables of the Seqtoks class @{@%
var \$tokenlist; // Note: first token is nr. 1.
var \$nrtokens;
var \$sentencelist;
var \$paragraphlist;
var \$ljn;
var \$seg;
@| tokenlist sentencelist paragraphlist@}


The tokenlist is an array with two subscripts. The second index is the
sequence number. The first index has the following value:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
  \texttt{offset} & Offset of the token.               \\
  \texttt{class}  & Token class.                       \\
  \texttt{casus}  & Case (if the token is a word).     \\
  \texttt{text}   & The word (if the token is a word). \\
  \texttt{stem}   & The word-stem. \\
\end{tabular}


\subsection{Get the tokens from the database}

  @< construct Seqtoks @>
}
@| @}

\subsection{Print a paragraph}
\label{sec:printpar}

Paragraphs will be printed in the natural order. To minimise problems
with indexes, use a function that processes at each call the next
paragraph and a function that resets to start again. The functions
return "false" if there is nothing to print.

Since the \verb|paragraphlist| is a multi-dimensional array, we cannot
easily use the \texttt{reset} and \texttt{current} array
function. Therefore, use the following variable,
\verb|$parrec|. This variable contains either an array with
pointers to the first and last token or the boolean \texttt{FALSE}.

@d variables of the Seqtoks class @{@%
var \$parrec;
@| \$parrec @}

Variable \texttt{parrec} contains either an array with pointers to the
first/last token of the paragraph or, when every paragraph has been
processed, the boolean \texttt{FALSE}.

@d update parrec @{@%
if(current(\$this->paragraphlist["first"])===FALSE){
  \$this->parrec=FALSE;
} else {
  \$this->parrec=array( "first" => current(\$this->paragraphlist["first"])
                      ,  "last" => current(\$this->paragraphlist["last"])
                      );
};
@| @}


Initially, reset the arrays in \texttt{paragraphlist}.

@d methods of the Seqtoks class @{@%

\section{Find out whether the paragraph is relevant}
\label{sec:par-relevance}

A paragraph is considered to be relevant wrt a concept if enough parts of it match
strings of the search-document of the concept. Find out whether the
current paragraph is relevant. To determine this for a concept, add up the weights
of the matching fingerprint strings. The following function produces
a boolean array in which the relevance for the active concepts is reported.

\section{Generate tags to annotate matching strings}
\label{sec:annotations}

Find the numbers of the tokens where matching strings begin and end
and associate \HTML{} tags to these points. The phrases are wrapped in
span tags, of which the class names are composed by the letter ``f''
followed by the numbers of the active concepts in letters. For
example, a phrase that is relevant for concepts two and three is
surrounded by a \verb|<span class="fonetwo">| and a \verb|</span>| tag.

To annotate the phrases in this way, we generate an array that
contains for every point where a relevant phrase begins or ends the
number of the token and an array with an entry for each of the active
concepts. This entry is \verb|+n| if the token is the first one of $n$
relevant phrases for that concept and \verb|-n| if it is the last
token of such phrase. If the token is only a single-word phrase it is
assigned an asterix (\verb|*|).

Increment the element of matchpoint of which the index is equal to the

asterix to the corresponding element in matchpoint unless the element
contains a number.

To print a token, first find out whether it is on one of the ends of
matching strings. If so, check whether it is at the end of matching
strings and generate end-tags in that case. Then, check whether it is
at the start of phrases and generate begin-tags in that case.

To generate the right tags, remember the concepts for which the
current token is an element of matching strings.

@%The following algorithm (from~\cite{wildeboer2007a}) will be used to
@%determine what has to be highlighted in the text:
@%
@%\begin{enumerate}
@%\item The verdict is separated into paragraphs: paragraphs are
@%      separated by enters or even white space.
@%\item Within each paragraph, the number of fingerprint terms found is counted.
@%\item If there are only terms from one fingerprint (thus concept)
@%      in the paragraph (which can visually be noted by the presence of
@%      only one color):
@%  \begin{enumerate}
@%    \item If there are more than two terms present, the paragraph
@%          is deemed relevant for that concept.
@%    \item If one or two terms, but consisting of more than a
@%          single word, the paragraph is deemed relevant for that concept.
@%    \item If two terms of only one word, but differing, the paragraph
@%          is deemed relevant for that concept.
@%    \item If only one term of one word, the paragraph isn't deemed
@%          relevant for that concept.
@%  \end{enumerate}
@%\item If more than one concept is described by its fingerprint
@%      terms in the paragraph (more than one color visible):
@%  \begin{enumerate}
@%    \item Above rules are applicable for every concept, but
@%          if a concept is only described by one term, of
@%          one word, but is in the same sentence as a
@%          term from the other concept, the paragraph is
@%          deemed relevant for that concept as well (a
@%          sentence is defined as the string from the last
@%          uppercase letter following a period, until the next
@%          period followed by an uppercase letter)

\subsection{Wrap into Ajax function}
\label{sec:wrapinajax}

To enable fast reloading of the verdict, we create an xajax function
that calls the above defined function \verb|printannotatedverdict| in
the proper way, and sends the produced string to the remote website
for displaying.

The \textsc{html} code in the body of the web page contains
placeholders that will be filled in by the xajax function.

@d placeholder for the annotated verdict @{@%
printf("<div id=\"verdictplace\"></div>\n");
@| @}

@d  button to select entire doc or relevant parts only @{@%
printf("<div id=\"textmodebutton\"></div>");
@%printf("<button ");
@%printf(   "onclick=\"");
@%printf(      "xajax_printhelemaal(");
@%printf(         "<div id=\"printhelemaalarg\"></div>");
@%printf(      ")");
@%printf(   "\"");
@%printf(">");
@%printf(  "<div id=\"textselectionbuttontext\">");
@%printf(  "</div>");
@%printf("</button>\n");
@| @}

The xajax function \verb|printhelemaal| generates the \textsc{html}
code of an annotated verdict and it generates the argument for itself
within a button with which the user can switch between displaying the
entire document or only the relevant parts.

\textbf{Note:} in \php{}, 0 is associated with \qstring{false} and~1
associated with \qstring{true}.

To visualise the annotations we use \verb|<span>| tags. The mark-up is
determined in the cascaded style sheet. The \verb|<span>| class
\verb|m4_conceptparone| serves to typeset paragraphs to be annotated
and  the class \verb|m4_conceptwordone| serves to typeset phrases to
be annotated.


\subsubsection{Copy and annotate}
\label{sec:copyandannotate}

To copy the verdict onto the screen of the user, with annotations,
proceeds as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Read the entire text of the verdict into string \verb|\$tekst|.
\item Copy a chunk of the text in variable \verb|\$chunk|.
\item Prepend the line-feed characters in the chunk with \verb|<br>| tags.
\item If the chunk is to be annotated, print annotation code.
\item print the chunk.
\item If the chunk is at the end of an annotated section, print
  end-annotation code.
\end{enumerate}

The variable \verb|\$offset| is a pointer to the first character in
the \verb|\tekst| array that still has to be copied. Initially it has
a value of~1.


@%@d print the annotated verdict @{@%
@%\$currloc=setlocale(LC_ALL,0);
@%@%printf("\n<!--- locale: %s --->\n", \$currloc);
@%@< init print the annotated verdict @>
@%
@%@< read the text of the verdict @>
@%\$offset=1;
@%@< copy chunks @>
@%@| @}

@%Currently we produce ordinary text and text that is marked up as
@%relevant paragraph or as relevant phrase. Model this as an automaton
@%with the following three states:
@%
@%\begin{description}
@%\item[ordinary:] Copy ordinary text.
@%\item[annotated-paragraph:] Copy text in an annotated paragraph.
@%\item[annotated-phrase:]  Copy text in an annotated phrase.
@%\end{description}
@%
@%The \qstring{annotated-phrase} mode is a sub-mode of the
@%\qstring{annotated-paragraph} mode. The position of the pointer
@%\verb|\offset| determines how the state changes. See
@%figure~\ref{fig:markstate}.

@%
@%To determine how the state has to be changed, we have to compare the

\section{Interface with the ontology}
\label{sec:ontology-interface}

The class \verb|ontologyconnect| serves as an interface with the
ontology. Currently it provides the following:
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{\`'\$rdfs\_subclass}:] Rdf \emph{Subclass} predicate for concepts
  that indicates that the object is a specialisation of the subject. \\ 
 
\item[\texttt{\`'\$rdfs\_comment}:] \emph{Comment} predicate. The
  object is an explanatory text of the subject, a legal concept. \\
\item[\texttt{\`'\$best\_preflabel}:]  \emph{Preflabel} predicate.
  The subject is a legal concept and the object is the title of this concept. \\ 
\item[\texttt{\`'\$selectquery(\`'\$query)}:] perform a \sparql{}
  \emph{select} query and return the \xml{}-encoded
  response. \\
\item[\texttt{get\_single\_element\_from\_queryxmlresult(\`'\$qresult,\`'\$type)}:]
  Decode the \xml{} result from a \sparql{} query that produces a list
  of single elements.
\end{description}

\subsection{The location of the ontology and url's}
\label{sec:ontolocation}

\subsubsection{The ontology}
\label{sec:ontologylocation}

Provide the location of the ontology, i.e.{} the host and the name of
the repository that contains the ontology.

@d variables of the Ontologyconnect class @{@%
  var \$host="m4_ontologyhost";
  var \$port="m4_ontologyport";
  var \$ontoname="m4_ontologyname";
  var \$repositoriesdir="m4_repositoriesdir";
  var \$repo_url;
@| \$host \$port \$ontoname @}

Create an \textsc{url} of the repository:

  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \textbf{symb.} & \textbf{full name} \\
      best & \url{m4_nsbest} \\
      owl  & \url{m4_nsowl} \\
      rdf  & \url{m4_nsrdf} \\
      rdfs & \url{m4_nsrdfs} \\
      xsd  & \url{m4_nsxsd}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Namespaces in use}
  \label{tab:namespaces}
\end{table}
 lists the namespaces are in use in the \texttt{best} ontology. In
 this program we will not use the name-space abbreviations but the
 full uri's including the namespace. Store the namespaces in
 variables:

@d variables of the Ontologyconnect class @{@%
var \$ns_best="m4_nsbest";
var \$ns_owl="m4_nsowl";
var \$ns_rdf="m4_nsrdf";
var \$ns_rdfs="m4_nsrdfs";
var \$ns_xsd="m4_nsxsd";
@| \$ns_best \$ns_owl \$ns_rdf \$ns_rdfs \$ns_xsd @}


The following method constructs
an uri from a namespace and an identifier:

@d methods of the Ontologyconnect class  @{@%
function curi(\$ns,\$id){
  return "<".\$ns.\$id.">";
}
@| curi @}

To print a full url in a web page, replace the \qstring{$<$} and
\qstring{$>$} characters in it by strings that are acceptable for
\textsc{html}. 

@d methods of the Ontologyconnect class  @{@%
function unhook_uri(\$uri){
  \$pat[0]="/\</";
  \$rep[0]="&#60";
  \$pat[1]="/\>/";
  \$rep[1]="&#62";
  return preg_replace(\$pat, \$rep, \$uri) ;
}

@| unhook_uri @}
 


Construct predicate uri's that we will need:

@d variables of the Ontologyconnect class @{@%
public \$rdfs_subclass;

\subsection{Perform queries}
\label{sec:performqueries}

To retrieve information from the ontology, the
\texttt{Ontologyconnect} class performs queries. In our application we
will use the \sparql{}\index{sparql}\index{Sparql} query-language
(\url{http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query}).


Perform a \qstring{select} query and return the \xml{}-coded
response. Argument: the query.
@d methods of the Ontologyconnect class @{@%
function selectquery(\$query){
  \$questar=array('query'=>\$query, 'queryLn'=>"m4_querylanguage");
  \$extendedurl=\$this->repo_url."?".http_build_query($questar);
  \$req=& new HTTP_Request($extendedurl);
  \$req->addHeader('Accept', 'application/sparql-results+xml, */*;q=0.5');
  if (PEAR::isError(\$req->sendRequest())) {
    return FALSE;
  } else {
    return \$req->getResponseBody();
  };
}

@| selectquery @}

The query results in a complicated \xml{} string. If the result ought
to be a single element, it can be extracted with the following method:

@d  methods of the Ontologyconnect class @{@%
function get_single_element_from_queryxmlresult(\$qresult, \$type){
  if(\$qresult===FALSE){
    return FALSE;
  } else {
    \$xml=new SimpleXMLElement(\$qresult);
    @< extract the proper type @(literal@) @>
    @< extract the proper type @(uri@) @>
  };
}

@| get_single_element_from_queryxmlresult @}

@d extract the proper type @{@%

  \$this->explanation=FALSE;
} else {
  \$xml=new SimpleXMLElement(\$response);
  \$this->title=\$xml->results[0]->result[0]->binding[0]->@1[0];
};

@| @}


Perform a query to retrieve a single object element. Arguments: 1)
subject, 2) predicate and 3) type of the result (e.g.{} \qstring{literal} or
\qstring{uri}.

@%@d methods of the Ontologyconnect class @{@%

\section{The Collexis search engine}
\label{sec:collexis}

To connect to Collexis and retrieve information a collexion of api's
exist. The classes for the api's are stored in the jar library
\verb|m4_extjar2|. Collexis can be connected to with
\textsc{soap}. Therefore, it should be possible to implement a
connection directly in \php{} using the description file
\texttt{collexissoaptoolbox.wsdl}. However, the latter file is
currently not available, but a Java example is available. Therefore,
we will construct a pipeline that starts up a Java program. The
following function \verb|get_related_document_refs| returns a list of
\textsc{ljn}'s and fingerprint documents related to the document of
which the name is in variable \verb|\$pointerdoc|.

@d php functions @{@%
  @< Collexis-related php functions @>
@|  @}

@d Collexis-related php functions @{@%

@%  @< pemess @("<p>Task:<br>".\$task."</p>"@) @>
  return parse_collexisdocrefs(monopipe(\$task));
}

@| get_related_document_refs @}

\subsection{The Java interface program}
\label{sec:javainterface}

The task in the pipeline is, to start up a Java virtual machine that
runs the following program:

\subsection{Parsing the results from Collexis}
\label{sec:parseresult}

To parse the results from Collexis, do the following: 1) get rid of
warning produced by the Java system (I do not yet not know how I can
avoid that they appear) and 2) extract for each of the record elements
the \texttt{id} attribute. The function \verb|parse_collexisdocrefs|
produces an array with the document names.

The Java \xml{} software should generate a proper \xml{} string, but
in fact it prepends the \xml{} with warnings in plain english. I do
not yet know how to avoid them. Remove these warnings. First check
whether the string actually contains \xml{}. If so, remove text that
prepends the first \xml{} tag.

\section{Concept}
\label{sec:concept}

The most important entity in this program is the \qstring{legal
concept}. The legal problem of the user is analysed and split up in a
collection of legal concepts. The legal ontology shows how the legal
concepts are related to each other. The Collexis data-mining software
finds verdicts for which the concepts are relevant. These concepts are
found with the aid of typical phrases and sentences. We use these
sentences to annotate the verdicts. The php class \texttt{Concept}
handles everything related to concepts. We will create an object of
this class for every concept that is relevant in a session.

\subsection{Load the concept}

\subsection{Annotate a text-string}
\label{sec:annotate}

To find out whether e.g.{} a text paragraph is relevant w.r.t.{} the
concept and to annotate the paragraph, search for occurrences of the
fingerprints in it. The method \verb|match| accepts a string and
matches the fingerprint strings with it.


@%\textbf{NOTE:} We have the convention that the offset\index{offset,
@%  convention} of a matching string is the number of the first
@%character, counting from unity.

Store of every match the
following:
\begin{itemize}
\item The offset and the length;
\item The number of the fingerprint string.
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, store the following statistics:

\begin{itemize}
\item The number of single-word strings that match;
\item The number of multiple-word strings that match;
\item The sum of the weights of the matching strings.
\end{itemize}

@d variables of the Concepto class @{@%

  };

Perform the match. Note that function \verb|stripos| ignores the
difference between uppercase and lowercase and that it considers the
offset of the first character to be zero.

I hope that the magic with \verb|\$sconcept| is not too
confusing. After the initialisation it contains the number of the
active concept. This is used to check whether the concept to be listed
is the active concept. Then \verb|\$sconcept| is made empty and serves
to create a querystring with the current concept number in it.

\section{Concepts management}
\label{sec:whichconcepts}

When the display program starts, it obtains the \ID's of one or more
concepts that are relevant for the case. One or more of these concepts
can be \emph{active} i.e.{} they are explained and relevant paragraphs
in verdicts are highlighted.

In concept-oriented mode, at most a single concept is active, but in
document-oriented mode, the user may select a set of multiple
\qstring{active} concepts, to be highlighted in a displayed verdict.

@%Probably it is not useful to illuminate a very large
@%quantity of concepts at the same time. The amount of colours needed to
@%illuminate every combination of $n$ concepts is equal to $2^n$. Therefore, we will limit this
@%to m4_maxactiveconcepts \qstring{active} concepts. The set of active concept
@%is passed as argument of the \verb|m4_conceptnumkeyword| in the
@%query-string.

The class \verb|Conceptset| stores the concepts as objects and the set of active concepts in the
current web page. It provides the following methods:

\begin{tabular}{lp{10cm}}
  \texttt{Conceptset()} & Constructor. Reads concept list from the querystring. \\
  \texttt{concept(num)} & Returns Concepto object of concept nr.~\texttt{num}.
                             Note that counting starts from unity, not from zero. \\
  \texttt{active\_concept(num)} & Returns active Concepto object
                          nr.~\texttt{num}. \\
  \texttt{first\_concept()} & Returns the first concept or \texttt{FALSE} if there is none. \\
  \texttt{current\_concept()} & Returns the last requested concept or \texttt{FALSE} if such a concept is not present. \\
  \texttt{next\_concept()} & Returns the next concept or \texttt{FALSE} if there is no next concept. \\
  \texttt{first\_active\_concept()} & Returns the first active concept or \texttt{FALSE} if there is none. \\
  \texttt{current\_active\_concept()} & Returns the last requested active concept or \texttt{FALSE} if such a concept is not present. \\
  \texttt{next\_active\_concept()} & Returns the next active concept or \texttt{FALSE} if there is no next active concept. \\
  \texttt{first\_non\_active\_concept()} & Returns the first non-active concept or \texttt{FALSE} if there is none. \\
  \texttt{current\_non\_active\_concept()} & Returns the last requested non-active concept or \texttt{FALSE} if such a concept is not present. \\
  \texttt{next\_non\_active\_concept()} & Returns the next non-active concept or \texttt{FALSE} if there is no next non-active concept. \\
  \texttt{conceptcount()} & Returns number of stored concepts. \\
  \texttt{nr}           & Returns number of active concepts. \\
  \texttt{arra}         & Returns array with numbers of active concepts \\
  \texttt{querystring\_with\_conceptnr(num)} & 
                  Returns querystring in which concept-number
                  \texttt{num} is made active. This can be pasted in an \textsc{url}. \\
  \texttt{querystring\_without\_conceptnr(num)} &
         Returns querystring with concept-numbers excluding \texttt{num}. \\
  \texttt{is\_active\_concept(num)} &
        Returns whether concept \texttt{num} is an active concept. \\
  \texttt{concept\_seqnum(num)} &
       Returns a sequential number if concept \texttt{num} is active, or returns~0 otherwise. \\
  \texttt{store\_old\_concepts()} & Temporary provision. Stores the old-fashioned ``fp''-style concepts. \\
  \texttt{querystring\_with\_conceptlist()} & Temporary provision. Generates a querystring
                       in which the \ID's of the stored concepts. \\
\end{tabular}

We consider the active concept set a global feature for the whole of
the page in which it is used.

\section{External program performs task}
\label{sec:externalpipe}

In at least one case (cf.~section~\ref{sec:collexis}) we want a
sub-task to be performed by an external, non-php program. 


The function \verb|monopipe| sets up a
mono-directional pipe to perform the task in the argument and returns
the output of the process, assuming that the output consists of lines
of text.

@d the monopipe function @{@%
function monopipe(\$task){
  \$handle = popen(\$task, 'r');

\section{Ajax}
\label{chap:ajax}

To make the pages more responsive on user interactions, we use
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX}{Ajax} (Asynchonous Javascript
and \xml{}). We use the \php{} \href{http://xajaxproject.org/}{xajax} module.


\subsection{Ajax initialisation}

To initialise xajax, load its php library and initialise an
\verb|xajax| object.

@d initialize xajax @{@%
require('xajax/xajax.inc.php');
\$xajax = new xajax(); 
@| \$xajax @}

Create functions that make ajax do what is has to do and register
them.

@d  initialize xajax @{@%

Process initial requests.

@d initialize xajax @{@%

@%
@%The \qstring{Programs} are in fact two \textsc{php} files that are processed
@%by the \textsc{http} server (i.c.{} Apache) on request of remote
@%browsers. One of the programs serves to actually present the verdicts
@%to clients and the other program is a \qstring{back-door} that can be used
@%by maintainers to edit help-texts.
@%
@%
@%
@%The program texts of the two programs are similar. 
@%The \qstring{meat} part of the page, that will be displayed, is determined
@%by the function \verb|content()|. Most of the other stuff creates a
@%\textsc{html} page, loads javascripts and defines \textsc{php}
@%functions.
@%

@%  chooses to modify a concept helptext, a
@%list of concepts is presented. Otherwise 
@%
@%\begin{itemize}
@%\item Start with the \verb|verdictslist|
@%  (section~\ref{sec:demoresources}) and the two concepts (files
@%  \verb|testconcept.conc| and \verb|GevaarVoorPersonenOfZaken.conc|.
@%\item Show the list of files and the names of the concepts in the
@%  browser. The user may select a document (and a concept).
@%\item Pre-process the document:
@%  \begin{itemize}
@%  \item Identify the beginnings and end-points sentences and
@%    paragraphs (\qstring{sentence splitter})
@%  \item Split up the document as a list of tokens.
@%  \item Stem the word-types in the document.
@%  \end{itemize}
@%\item Identify words and phrases that are listed in the search document.
@%\item Apply certain heuristic rules to tag some of the words
@%  and phrases and associate them with words and phrases in the search document.
@%\item Present the document.
@%\end{itemize}

@%This results in a collection of documents in which relevant terms and
@%phrases have been tagged. This collection is presented to a user as
@%follows:

%The program displays a list with the names (and some features?) of the
%documents. The list is sorted to decreasing rank. When the user clicks
%on one of the documents, its contents are presented in a text window.
%A second window contains the terms and phrases of the \qstring{search
%document}. When the user clicks on one of the terms or phrases, the
%sentences in the document that are associated with it will be
%highlighted (displayed in a special colour), and the word or phrase
%itself will be highlighted with another colour.


@%\subsection{Communication between pages}
@%\label{sec:communication}
@%
@%Most of the time the user interacts with the program by clicking on a
@%\verb|<a>| tag with as target the address of page itself, followed by
@%a query-string that contains parameters that tell the program what to
@%do.
@%
@%In this application we use the following parameters:




@%\section{Provide help}

\chapter{How to read and translate this document}
\label{chap:translatedoc}

This document is an example of \emph{literate
  programming}~\cite{Knuth:1983:LP}. It contains the code of all sorts
of scripts and programs, combined with explaining texts. In this
document the literate programming tool \texttt{nuweb} is used, that is
currently available from sourceforge
(URL:\url{nuweb.sourceforge.net}). The advantages of Nuweb are, that
it can be used for every programming language and scripting language, that
it can contain multiple program sources and that it is very simple.

\section{Read this document}
\label{sec:read}

The document contains \emph{code scraps} that are collected into
output files. An output file (e.g. \texttt{output.fil}) shows up in the text as follows:

\begin{alltt}
"output.fil" \textrm{4a \(\equiv\)}
      # output.fil
      \textrm{\(<\) a macro 4b \(>\)}
      \textrm{\(<\) another macro 4c \(>\)}
      \(\diamond\)

\end{alltt}

The above construction contains text for the file. It is labelled with
a code (in this case 4a)  The constructions between the \(<\) and
\(>\) brackets are macro's, placeholders for texts that can be found
in other places of the document. The test for a macro is found in
conctructions that look like:

\begin{alltt}
\textrm{\(<\) a macro 4b \(>\) \(\equiv\)}
     This is a scrap of code inside the macro.
     It is concatenated with other scraps inside the
     macro. The concatenated scraps replace
     the invocation of the macro.

{\footnotesize\textrm Macro defined by 4b, 87e}
{\footnotesize\textrm Macro referenced in 4a}
\end{alltt}

Macro's can be defined on different places. They can contain other macros.

\begin{alltt}
\textrm{\(<\) a scrap 87e \(>\) \(\equiv\)}
     This is another scrap in the macro. It is
     concatenated to the text of scrap 4b.
     This scrap contains another macro:
     \textrm{\(<\) another macro 45b \(>\)}

{\footnotesize\textrm Macro defined by 4b, 87e}
{\footnotesize\textrm Macro referenced in 4a}
\end{alltt}

\subsection{Directories and files}
\label{sec:directorystructure}

This documents generates a bunch of files, scattered over multiple
directories. The main part of the development of this project takes
place in the directory in which the source of this document is placed,
\texttt{m4_nuwebdir}. It contains the Makefile of this project and the
files to typeset this document. The document can also be typeset as
\textsc{html}, in a separate directory, accesible for the web server.

@d parameters in Makefile @{@%
DevHome= m4_devhome
NuwebHome= m4_nuwebdir
NuwebHtmlDir = m4_htmldocdir
@| DevHome NuwebHome @}

The project uses multiple programming languages. The Java part is
developed in its own directory structure, with sub-directories for the
java-sources, for the class files (\texttt{obj}) and for the jar files
(\texttt{lib}). Other binaries go into the \texttt{BinDir} directory.

The \texttt{lib} dir is also to contain include files with php classes.

@d parameters in Makefile @{@%
BinDir = m4_bindir
PhpDir = m4_phpdir
DevRoot = m4_devroot
SourceDir = \$(DevRoot)/src
TargetDir = \$(DevRoot)/obj
LibDir =  \$(DevRoot)/lib
@| @}

The Java sources and objects are organised in packages. The Java
source files and class files are located in subdirectories that reflect the package name.
Currently we have only
one single package.

@d parameters in Makefile  @{@%
Packages= m4_collexispackagename
PackageDirs= m4_collexispackagedir
@%JavaCollexisPackageName = m4_packagename
@%CollexisPackageSourceDir = \$(SourceDir)/m4_collexispackagedir
@%CollexisPackageTargetDir = \$(TargetDir)/m4_collexispackagedir
@| Packages PackageDirs @}

The main part of this project is a web-interface with users. This is
located in a separate directory, accessible by the web browser:

@d parameters in Makefile @{@%
WebDir= m4_webdir
@| WebDir @}




Generate the directories if they do not yet exist:
@d expliciete make regels @{@%

@< make-directory target @(BinDir@) @>
@< make-directory target @(PhpDir@) @>
@| @}

Make the java source directories and target directories beforehand:

@d parameters in Makefile @{@%
JavaSourcePaths= \$(patsubst %,\$(SourceDir)/%,\$(PackageDirs))
JavaDestPaths= \$(patsubst %,\$(TargetDir)/%,\$(PackageDirs))

	\$(MakeDir) \$(JavaDestPaths)
	touch javadestdirs

@| @}


The nuweb source generates java files, that must be compiled into
class files, that must be stored in a jar. It is possible, that
external class files are needed for the compilation and
execution. Create Makefile symbols for the lists of the java files,
the list of class files and the \qstring{ClassPath}, the jar file and the
name of the java-file that contains the \qstring{Main} method.

We start with a list of the paths to java filenames  from the
\textsc{src} directory.

@d parameters in Makefile @{@%
JavaFiles = \
  @< add java source filename @>

@| @}

Generate a list of the class files into which the java-files compile:

@d parameters in Makefile @{@%
JavaClassFiles = \$(JavaFiles:%.java=  %.class)

Generate lists with the full paths to the java files and the class
paths:

@d parameters in Makefile @{@%
JavaFullPaths = \$(JavaFiles:%.java= \$(SourceDir)/%.java)
JavaClassFullPaths = \$(JavaClassFiles:%.class= \$(TargetDir)/%.class)
@| @}


@%We need a list of names of class-files within the package directorie,
@%because that is how they will be stored in the jar file, and we will
@%need a list of full paths of the class-files, because that is the way
@%that they will be stored in the target directory. Generate both lists
@%from the \verb|JavaFile| symbol.

@%@| @}

The \verb|ClassPath| list is a concatenation of paths to java libs,
paths to class files that are external to this project and the target
directory:

@d parameters in Makefile @{@%
ClassPath = \$(JavasetLibs):\$(ExternalClasses):\$(TargetDir)

\subsection{Processing the figures in this document}
\label{sec:figureprocessing}

This document contains figures that have been made by
\texttt{xfig}. Post-process the figures to enable inclusion in this
document.

The list of figures to be included:

@d parameters in Makefile @{@%
FIGFILES=horseshoe annotatestate fileschema mainflow helpeditflow

@| FIGFILES @}

We use the package \texttt{figlatex} to include the pictures. This
package expects two files with extensions \verb|.pdftex| and
\verb|.pdftex_t| for \texttt{pdflatex} and two files with extensions \verb|.pstex| and
\verb|.pstex_t| for the \texttt{latex}/\texttt{dvips}
combination. Probably tex4ht uses the latter two formats too.

Make lists of the graphical files that have to be present for
latex/pdflatex:

@d parameters in Makefile @{@%
FIGFILENAMES=\$(foreach fil,\$(FIGFILES), \$(fil).fig)
PDFT_NAMES=\$(foreach fil,\$(FIGFILES), \$(fil).pdftex_t)
PDF_FIG_NAMES=\$(foreach fil,\$(FIGFILES), \$(fil).pdftex)
PST_NAMES=\$(foreach fil,\$(FIGFILES), \$(fil).pstex_t)
PS_FIG_NAMES=\$(foreach fil,\$(FIGFILES), \$(fil).pstex)

@|FIGFILENAMES PDFT_NAMES PDF_FIG_NAMES PST_NAMES PS_FIG_NAMES@}

Make similar lists for the latex/html (section~\ref{sec:html}):

@d parameters in Makefile @{@%
HTML_PS_FIG_NAMES=\$(foreach fil,\$(FIGFILES), \$(NuwebHtmlDir)/\$(fil).pstex)
HTML_PST_NAMES=\$(foreach fil,\$(FIGFILES), \$(NuwebHtmlDir)/\$(fil).pstex_t)

\subsection{Bibliography}
\label{sec:bbliography}

To keep this document portable, create a portable bibliography
file. It works as follows: This document refers in the
\texttt|bibliography| statement to the local \verb|bib|-file
\verb|m4_progname.bib|. To create this file, copy the auxiliary file
to another file \verb|auxfil.aux|, but replace the argument of the
command \verb|\bibdata{m4_progname}| to the names of the bibliography
files that contain the actual references (they should exist on the
computer on which you try this). This procedure should only be
performed on the computer of the author. Therefore, it is dependent of
a binary file on his computer.

@d expliciete make regels @{@%

\subsection{Typesetting a PDF document}
\label{sec:typesetting}

This document can be typeset as a document that is primarily suitable for
printing (i.e.{} a \pdf{} document) or a as a document  that is
primarily suitable to be viewed in a browser (i.e.{} a \textsc{html}
document).

In \LaTeX{}, typesetting is done in a repeating cycle. When the
\LaTeX{} compiler processes a source document, it writes information
like the locations of labels in an auxiliary file. This information
may be needed before it is produced. Therefore, the source has to be
processed another time. In Nuweb, things are even more complicated,
because Nuweb may need information that must be produced by the
\LaTeX{} compiler. Therefore, create a script that repeats execution
of nuweb and \LaTeX{} until the information in the auxiliary file does
no longer change.

@d parameters in Makefile @{@%
W2PDF=./w2pdf

@< filenames in nuweb compile script @>
@< compile nuweb @>

@| @}
')m4_dnl

m4_opencompilfil(`',`w2pdf',`pdflatex')m4_dnl

The script retains a copy of the latest version of the auxiliary file.
Then it runs the four processors nuweb, \LaTeX{}, MakeIndex and
bib\TeX{}, and compares the latest version with the retained version.


@d compile nuweb @{@%
@< run the processors until the aux file remains unchanged @>
@< remove the copy of the aux file @>
@| @}

The user provides the name of the nuweb file as argument. Strip the
extension (e.g.\ \verb|.w|) from the filename and create the names of
the \LaTeX{} file (ends with \verb|.tex|), the auxiliary file (ends
with \verb|.aux|) and the copy of the auxiliary file (add \verb|old.|
as a prefix to the auxiliary filename).

@d filenames in nuweb compile script @{@%
nufil=\$1

texfil=\${trunk}.tex
auxfil=\${trunk}.aux
oldaux=old.\${trunk}.aux
indexfil=\${trunk}.idx
oldindexfil=old.\${trunk}.idx
@| nufil trunk texfil auxfil oldaux indexfil oldindexfil @}

Remove the old copy if it is no longer needed.
@d remove the copy of the aux file @{@%
rm \$oldaux
@| @}

Run the three processors. Do not use the option \verb|-o| (to suppres
generation of program sources) for nuweb,  because \verb|w2pdf| must
be kept up to date as well.

@d run the three processors @{@%

Repeat to copy the auxiliary file and the index file  and run the processors until the
auxiliary file and the index file are equal to their copies.
 However, since I have not yet been able to test the \verb|aux|
file and the \verb|idx| in the same test statement, currently only the
\verb|aux| file is tested.

It turns out, that sometimes a strange loop occurs in which the
\verb|aux| file will keep to change. Therefore, with a counter we
prevent the loop to occur more than m4_maxtexloops times.

@d run the processors until the aux file remains unchanged @{@%
LOOPCOUNTER=0

\subsection{Typesetting HTML}
\label{sec:html}

\textsc{Html} is easier to read on-line than a \pdf{} document that
was made for printing. We use \verb|tex4ht| to generate \HTML{}
code. An advantage of this system is, that we can include figures
in the same way as we do for \verb|pdflatex|.

Nuweb creates a \LaTeX{} file that is suitable
for \verb|latex2html| if the source file has \verb|.hw| as suffix instead of
\verb|.w|. However, this feature is not compatible with tex4ht.

The \textsc{html} files might have to be located on a place where they are
accessible by the web-server. Therefore, we create a directory at a
suitable place, copy the necessary sourcefiles into it and generate
the \textsc{html}. The following files must be copied:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The nuweb source.
\item Files with figures.
\item The bibliography (\texttt{.bib}) file.
\item The file \texttt{rapport3.4ht}
\end{enumerate}

Apart from this, a special file, needed by \texttt{tex4ht}, must be copied.

Furthermore, Nuweb installs the Bash script \texttt{w2html} into the
html directory.

@d copy to html-dir @{@%
\$(NuwebHtmlDir)/@1 : @1 \$(NuwebHtmlDir)/
	\$(Copy) \$< \$@@

@d expliciete make regels @{@%
@< copy to html-dir @(m4_progname.w@) @>
@< copy to html-dir @(m4_progname.bib@) @>
@| @}

We also need a file with the same name as the documentstyle and suffix
\verb|.4ht|. Just copy the file \verb|report.4ht| from the tex4ht
distribution. Currently this seems to work.

@d expliciete make regels @{@%

The script is very much like the \verb|w2pdf| script, but at this
moment I have still difficulties to compile the source smoothly into
\textsc{html} and that is why I make a separate file and do not
recycle parts from the other file. However, the file works similar.

To work for \textsc{html}, nuweb \emph{must} be run with the \verb|-n|
option, because there are no page numbers.

When the compilation has been satisfied, run makeindex in a special
way, run bibtex again (I don't know why this is necessary) and then run htlatex another time.

Make a dvi file with \texttt{w2html} and then run
\texttt{htlatex}.

	cd \$(NuwebHtmlDir) && ./w2html m4_progname.w

\subsection{Pre-process and unpack the Nuweb source}
\label{sec:nuweb}

As shown in figure~\ref{fig:fileschema} the real source,
\texttt{a\_`'m4_progname`'.w} must be preprocessed to generate the proper
nuweb file. The following two tasks must be performed:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Process \verb|\$| characters.
\item Run the m4 pre-processor.
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Process \qstring{dollar} characters }
\label{sec:procdollars}

Many \qstring{intelligent} \TeX{} editors (e.g.\ the auctex utility of
Emacs) handle \verb|\$| characters as special, to switch into
mathematics mode. This is irritating in program texts, that often
contain \verb|\$| characters as well. Therefore, we make a stub, that
translates the two-character sequence \verb|\\$| into the single
\verb|\$| character.

@d expliciete make regels @{@%
m4_`'m4_progname`'.w : a_`'m4_progname`'.w
	gawk '{gsub(/[\\][\\$\$]/, "$$");print}' a_`'m4_progname`'.w > m4_`'m4_progname`'.w

@% $
@| @}


\subsubsection{Run the M4 pre-processor}
\label{sec:m4}

Run the M4 processor to expand macro's and merge the files
\verb|inst.m4| and \verb|texinclusions.m4|
@d  expliciete make regels @{@%
m4_progname`'.w : m4_`'m4_progname`'.w  inst.m4 texinclusions.m4
	m4 -P m4_`'m4_progname`'.w > m4_progname`'.w

@| @}


\subsubsection{Unpack the nuweb source}
\label{sec:unpack}

Run nuweb to extract the program sources from the nuweb file, but
suppress the creation of the \LaTeX{} documentation.
Nuweb creates only sources that do not yet exist or that have been
modified. Therefore \texttt{make} does not have to check this. 

@d make targets @{@%
sources : m4_progname.w inst.m4 texinclusions.m4 \
          \$(NuwebHtmlDir)/ \$(BinDir) javasourcedirs \$(LibDir)
	nuweb -t m4_progname.w
@< make executables executable @>

@| @}

@d executable @{@%
	chmod 775 @1@%
@| @}



\subsection{Targets}
\label{sec:targets}

The following targets should be useful for the user:

\begin{description}
\item[pdf:] Generate a \pdf{} document.
\item[html:] Generate the \texttt{html} document.
\item[view:] View the document.
\item[print:] Print the document.
\item[run:] Run the program.
\item[lib:] Generate the jar file with the class files.
\end{description}

First the targets for typesetting/viewing:

@d expliciete make regels @{@%

pdf : m4_progname.pdf

html : m4_htmltarget

view : m4_progname.pdf
	\$(DocumentViewer) m4_progname.pdf

print : m4_progname.pdf
	\$(Print) m4_progname.pdf

@| @}



The rules to run and produce a library are a bit more
complicated. Nuweb checks whether the java-file sources have to be
renewed or not. The means, that we cannot set the nuweb source as a
preqequisite for every class file, because this would couse a nuweb
run for every class file in the package. Therefore, run nuweb first in
a sub-process and generate class files and the final targets in
another sub-process:

@d expliciete make regels  @{@%
run : 
	\$(MAKE) \$(MakeOptions) sources
	\$(MAKE) \$(MakeOptions) runjava

lib :
	@@\$(MAKE) \$(MakeOptions) sources
	@@\$(MAKE) \$(MakeOptions) javalib


runjava : \$(JavaClassFullPaths)
	\$(Echo) "Class files: " \$(JavaClassFiles)
	\$(Echo) "Class reqs: " \$(JavaClassFullPaths)
	\$(Echo) \$(JavaRun)
	\$(JavaRun)

javalib : \$(JarFile)

\$(JarFile) : \$(JavaClassFullpaths) \$(LibDir)
	@@cd \$(TargetDir); \$(JavaArchiver) -cf \$@@ \$(JavaClassFiles)

@| @}

Make the class files. First make sure that the destination directories
exist.


@d impliciete make regels @{@%
\$(TargetDir)/%.class : \$(SourceDir)/%.java javadestdirs
	\$(Echo) \$@@
	@@\$(JavaCompiler) \$(JavaCompilerOptions) \$<

%.class : \$(PackageSourceDir)/%.java
	@@\$(MAKE) \$(MakeOptions) \$(PackageTargetDir)/\$@@


@| @}




\subsubsection{The w2pdf script}
\label{sec:w2pdf}

The three processors nuweb, \LaTeX{} and bib\TeX{} are
intertwined. \LaTeX{} and bib\TeX{} create parameters or change the
value of parameters, and write them in an auxiliary file. The other
processors may need those values to produce the correct output. The
\LaTeX{} processor may even need the parameters in a second
run. Therefore, consider the creation of the (\pdf) document finished
when none of the processors causes the auxiliary file to change. This
is performed by a shell script \verb|w2pdf|

Note, that in the following \texttt{make} construct, the implicit rule
\verb|.w.pdf| is not used. It turned out, that make did not calculate
the dependencies correctly when I did use this rule.

@d  impliciete make regels@{@%
@%.w.pdf : 
%.pdf : %.w \$(W2PDF) $(PDF_FIG_NAMES) $(PDFT_NAMES)
	chmod 775 \$(W2PDF)
	\$(W2PDF) \$*

@| @}


@d expliciete make regels  @{@%
\$(W2PDF) : m4_progname.w
	nuweb m4_progname.w
